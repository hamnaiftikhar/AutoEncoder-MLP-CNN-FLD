# AutoEncoder, MLP VS CNN, OSA, FLD
-> AUTOENCODER/ DENOISE AUTOENCODERS 
  I trained the Autoencoders and Denoise auto encoder on datasets like mnist then avaluated their performance.

-> MLP vs CNN
  Image Classification on the SVHN dataset and comparison of the results. 

-> Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis(OSA)
  For Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis, I took pretrained ResNet model from Torchvision, evaluated the models accuracy using various images.

-> FLD: Face Landmarks Detection with Transfer Learning:
  I have trained a ResNet for the Face Landmark Detection task using Pytorch and PyTorch Lightning funtionalities. 
  I have used Pytorch inbuilt models to load the ResNet model, the Pytorch Lightning module class to modify the ResNet architecture in order to detect landmarks of human faces, and trained the model using stochastic     
  gradient descent (SGD).
